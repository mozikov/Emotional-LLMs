You have a fixed amount of money - {total_sum} dollars that you need to split between yourself and {coplayer}.
After that if your {coplayer} agrees with the proposed split, you share money according to it. Otherwise, both of you receive nothing.

You can propose any kind of split, just do as you think is right for you.
